### Steps:

3. **Fill in deployment details**:
   - **Subscription**: Choose your Azure subscription
   - **Resource Group**: Create new or use existing
   - **Site Name**: Auto-generated (or customize)
   - **Location**: Choose closest region
   - **SKU**: Free (perfect for testing)
4. **Click "Review + create"** then **"Create"**
5. **Wait for deployment** (takes 2-3 minutes)

### After Deployment:
1. **Go to your Static Web App** in Azure Portal
2. **Click "Authentication"** in the left menu

## Option 2: Manual GitHub Setup

If you want to fork the repository first:

### Step 1: Fork Repository
1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Group-Tree-Membership-Visualizer.git
   cd Group-Tree-Membership-Visualizer
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy with Your Fork
1. **Update the Deploy button** in your README to point to your fork
2. **Click Deploy to Azure** and use your repository URL
3. **Follow the same deployment steps** as Option 1

## Local Development (Optional)

Want to test locally first?

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

**Note**: Authentication only works after Azure deployment, but you can see the UI locally.

## What Gets Created

Your deployment creates:

âœ… **Azure Static Web App** - Hosts your application  
âœ… **GitHub Actions Workflow** - Automatic deployments  
âœ… **Microsoft App Registration** - Authentication (created automatically)  
âœ… **Microsoft Graph Permissions** - Data access  

**No manual app registration needed!** ðŸŽ‰

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Failed?
- Check if site name is unique globally
- Ensure you have Owner/Contributor access to the subscription
- Try a different Azure region

### Authentication Not Working?
- Ensure you completed the "After Deployment" steps
- Check that Microsoft identity provider was added
- Verify you're signing in with an organizational account

### Can't See Users/Groups?
- Ensure admin consent was granted
- Check that your account has appropriate permissions
- Contact your IT administrator if needed

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. **Test the application** with your organizational account
2. **Share the URL** with your team
3. **Customize the application** if needed
4. **Set up monitoring** (optional)
