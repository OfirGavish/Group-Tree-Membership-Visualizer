# Enhanced User and Device Information Display

## üéâ New Features Added

### Enhanced User Information Display

When viewing detailed information for users, the following additional properties are now displayed:

#### **User Details Section** (Overview Tab)
- **Status**: Shows if the user account is Enabled or Disabled
- **User Type**: Displays whether the user is a Member or Guest
- **Created Date**: When the user account was created in Entra ID
- **Last Sign-in**: Last interactive sign-in date and time
- **Licenses**: Count of assigned licenses

#### **New Licenses Tab** üìÑ
A dedicated tab showing comprehensive license information:
- **License SKUs**: All assigned license SKUs with their names
- **Service Plans**: Detailed service plan information within each license
- **Provisioning Status**: Status of each service plan (Success/Disabled/etc.)
- **Disabled Plans**: Any service plans that have been disabled

### Enhanced Device Information Display

When viewing detailed information for devices, the following additional properties are now displayed:

#### **Device Details Section** (Overview Tab)
- **Join Type**: How the device is joined (AzureADJoined, Hybrid, AzureADRegistered)
- **Owner**: The user who owns/registered the device
- **MDM**: Enrollment status in Mobile Device Management
- **Management Type**: How the device is being managed
- **Last Activity**: Last time the device was active/signed in
- **Registered**: When the device was registered in Entra ID

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend Data Fetching
- **`getAdditionalUserInfo()`**: Fetches extended user properties from Microsoft Graph
- **`getAdditionalDeviceInfo()`**: Fetches extended device properties from Microsoft Graph
- **Graph API Integration**: Uses appropriate Graph endpoints for comprehensive data

### Microsoft Graph API Endpoints Used

#### For Users:
```
GET /users/{id}?$select=id,displayName,userPrincipalName,mail,accountEnabled,createdDateTime,userType,assignedLicenses,signInActivity
GET /users/{id}?$select=signInActivity (beta endpoint for detailed sign-in data)
```

#### For Devices:
```
GET /devices/{id}?$select=id,displayName,deviceId,operatingSystem,operatingSystemVersion,isCompliant,isManaged,registrationDateTime,approximateLastSignInDateTime,managementType,joinType,deviceOwnership,enrollmentType
GET /devices/{id}/registeredOwners?$select=displayName,userPrincipalName
```

### Caching Strategy
- **User details**: Cached for 5 minutes to improve performance
- **Device details**: Cached for 10 minutes (device properties change less frequently)
- **Cache keys**: Unique per object ID to prevent data conflicts

### Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation**: If enhanced information fails to load, basic information is still displayed
- **Individual property handling**: Each property is checked for existence before displaying
- **API permission handling**: Handles cases where certain Graph API calls may not be permitted

## üé® UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Organization
- **Dedicated sections**: User and device details are organized in separate, clearly labeled sections
- **Color coding**: Status indicators use green/red colors for enabled/disabled states
- **Icon consistency**: Each section has appropriate emoji icons for easy recognition

### Information Hierarchy
- **Overview tab**: Shows most important information at a glance
- **Dedicated tabs**: Licenses get their own tab for users to avoid information overload
- **Progressive disclosure**: Details are revealed as users navigate through tabs

### Responsive Design
- **Flexible layouts**: Information adapts to different screen sizes
- **Grid layouts**: License service plans use responsive grid layouts
- **Readable typography**: Consistent font sizes and spacing for improved readability

   - **Azure Roles**: View Azure resource role assignments

### Viewing Device Information  
1. **Right-click** on a device node in the tree
2. **Select "Show Enhanced Details"** from the context menu
3. **Overview tab shows**:
   - Basic device info (OS, managed status, compliance)
   - Device details (join type, owner, MDM status, management type)
   - Activity information (last activity, registration date)

## üîç Data Quality and Accuracy

### Real-time Information
- **Fresh data**: Information is fetched directly from Microsoft Graph APIs
- **Cache balance**: Caching provides performance while ensuring data freshness
- **Consistent with Entra portal**: Data matches what administrators see in Azure portal

### Permission-aware Display
- **Graceful handling**: If certain information cannot be accessed due to permissions, other data is still shown
- **Clear indicators**: Missing or unavailable data is handled elegantly
- **No broken displays**: UI remains functional even with partial data

This enhanced information display provides administrators with comprehensive insights into user accounts and device status directly within the tree visualization, eliminating the need to switch between multiple portal interfaces.
