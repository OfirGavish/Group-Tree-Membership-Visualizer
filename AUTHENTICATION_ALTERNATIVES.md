# Alternative Authentication Approaches for Group Tree Membership Visualizer

## Current Approach: MSAL (Still Valid)
- **Status**: NOT deprecated, actively maintained by Microsoft
- **Pros**: Full control, works everywhere, most flexible
- **Cons**: Requires Azure App Registration setup

## Alternative 1: Azure Static Web Apps with Built-in Auth (RECOMMENDED)

### Benefits:
- ✅ **No custom app registration required**
- ✅ Built-in Microsoft provider
- ✅ Automatic token handling
- ✅ Serverless architecture
- ✅ Free tier available

### How it works:
1. Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps
2. Enable built-in authentication
3. Use `/.auth/me` endpoint to get user info
4. Use Azure Functions for Microsoft Graph calls with Managed Identity

### Setup Steps:
```bash
# 1. Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps
# 2. In Azure Portal -> Authentication -> Add Provider -> Microsoft
# 3. No app registration needed - Azure creates it automatically
```

## Alternative 2: Microsoft Graph Toolkit

### Benefits:
- ✅ Pre-built components
- ✅ Simplified authentication
- ✅ Ready-to-use UI components

### Implementation:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@microsoft/mgt/dist/bundle/mgt-loader.js"></script>
<mgt-msal2-provider client-id="your-app-id"></mgt-msal2-provider>
<mgt-person person-query="me"></mgt-person>
```

## Alternative 3: Server-Side with Azure Functions + Managed Identity

### Benefits:
- ✅ No client-side authentication complexity
- ✅ More secure (credentials never exposed to browser)
- ✅ Uses Managed Identity (no secrets)

### Architecture:
```
Browser -> Azure Functions -> Microsoft Graph API
           (Managed Identity)
```

## Recommendation: Azure Static Web Apps Approach

This eliminates the need for custom app registration while providing enterprise-grade security.

Would you like me to refactor the application to use this approach?
